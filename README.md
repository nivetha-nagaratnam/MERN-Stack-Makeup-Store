# Our Little Secret - Project 4 MERN Stack Project

## App Title

Travelogue is a travel blog that allows users to upload their travel experiences, while viewing other people's experiences. Our app allows users to create travel posts and add any pictures they would like to share from their visit. In addition to creating their own posts, users can add reviews to any other posts they find interesting. Users can also, view all the posts and reviews they have made when clicking their profile. Some cool features we added are a weather api and a map api. 
When a user creates a post anyone viewing that post can see the current weather for that speific city that the user visited and they are able to see where that city is located on the map.

## Next Steps

Some next steps would be is to add a seed file so the data is consistent for everyone in the group. We would have also liked to have a default profile picture for every user and have the option for the user to change their profile picture. Another feature we would like to include are travel recommendations, and this would be generated using an Expedia API. Another interesting feature could be to implement email confirmation for user registration.
